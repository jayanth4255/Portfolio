    about: `I’m a Full Stack Developer who loves building things that live on the web. My interest in web development started back in 2022 when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes — turns out hacking together HTML & CSS is pretty fun In an HACKATHON in my college.!

    Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of building software for various clients and personal projects. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences. I enjoy the constant change in the tech industry and the challenge of keeping up with it. When I'm not at the computer, I'm usually hanging out with my friends, playing chess, or just enjoying some good music.`
